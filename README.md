Within the project task, it is necessary to implement an information system that
keeps track of employees in an IT company. The information system should
include services for working with employees, a service for monitoring events in the system,
and a PKI service for managing certificates. The system is accessed by
engineers, human resources managers, project managers, and system administrators.
The main purpose of the application is to keep records of employees,
currently active and past projects, as well as all security-related events within the system.
